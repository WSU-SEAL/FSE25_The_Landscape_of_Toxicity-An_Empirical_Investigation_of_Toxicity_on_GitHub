# FSE25_The_Landscape_of_Toxicity-An_Empirical_Investigation_of_Toxicity_on_GitHub

This work is accepted for publication in The ACM International Conference on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE) research track.
#Deatils: We conducted a large-scale mixed-method empirical study of 2,828 GitHub-based OSS projects randomly selected based
on a stratified sampling strategy. Using ToxiCR, an SE domain-specific toxicity detector, we automatically
classified each comment as toxic or non-toxic. Additionally, we manually analyzed a random sample of 600
comments to validate ToxiCR’s performance and gain insights into the nature of toxicity within our dataset.
The results of our study suggest that profanity is the most frequent toxicity on GitHub, followed by trolling
and insults. While a project’s popularity is positively associated with the prevalence of toxicity, its issue
resolution rate has the opposite association. Corporate-sponsored projects are less toxic, but gaming projects
are seven times more toxic than non-gaming ones. OSS contributors who have authored toxic comments in
the past are significantly more likely to repeat such behavior. Moreover, such individuals are more likely to
become targets of toxic texts.
